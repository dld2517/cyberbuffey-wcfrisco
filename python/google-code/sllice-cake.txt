0.  create a set a..z
1. get the first char of input
2. push it onto the stack
3. compare the number of entries on the stack with the ordinal of the set
4. receive the next number
5. if it is one more, push, else pop
6. once we get to zero we have the unique set
7. place sets_counter at 1
8. we can keep processing the input, incrementing set counter
9? verify by checking primes.
