0. create a set a..z
1. get the first char
push it onto the stack
compare the number of entries on the stack with the ordinal of the set
receive the next number
if it is one more, push
if it is one less, pop
once we get to zero we have the unique set
place sets counter at 1
we can keep processing the input, incrementing sets counter
we can verify by checking primes

one issue...

i basically need to have a reset condition that gets hit and it would handle it.
soln: need a flag that remembers the size of the largest piece.
there will have to be lookahead programmed into this.

ababababcdeabababcababababababcdef
the lookahead counter will be
2 2 2 5 5 5 2
when the counter of elements on my stack becomes smaller than the number of yet-largest elemetns on the stack,
we meet a fail condition, keep the largest counter, and we start over.

new soln
two stacks
