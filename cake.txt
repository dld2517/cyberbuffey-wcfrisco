0. create a set a..z
1. get the first char
push it onto the stack
compare the number of entries on the stack with the ordinal of the set
receive the next number
if it is one more, push
if it is one less, pop
once we get to zero we have the unique set
place sets counter at 1
we can keep processing the input, incrementing sets counter
we can verify by checking primes
